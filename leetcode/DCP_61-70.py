    Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the pow(x, y) function, where x and y are integers and returns x^y.
    Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication.
    For example, pow(2, 10) should return 1024.

    There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. Given N and M, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.

    Given a 2 by 2 matrix, you should return 2, since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:
    - Right, then down
    - Down, then right
    Given a 5 by 5 matrix, there are 70 ways to get to the bottom-right.
