    Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k (inclusive), where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards represented as an array using only swaps.
    It should run in O(N) time.
    Hint: Make sure each one of the 52! permutations of the deck is equally likely.

    Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n, and contain the following methods:
    - set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least recently used item.
    - get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.
    Each operation should run in O(1) time.
