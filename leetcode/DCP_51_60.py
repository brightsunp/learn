    Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k (inclusive), where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards represented as an array using only swaps.
    It should run in O(N) time.
    Hint: Make sure each one of the 52! permutations of the deck is equally likely.
